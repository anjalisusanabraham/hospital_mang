					<p class="lead">From diagnosis to treating cancer and even managing certain cancer-related symptoms,
						surgery plays a crucial role. At the Surgical Oncology department, we cater surgical care for
						cancer to patients of all ages with the help of progressive technologies and experienced medical
						professional guidance.<br><br>
						There are various factors such as the size, location, type, stage and grade of the tumour and
						the general health condition of the people that are considered while planning for the surgical
						treatment.<br><br>
						According to the patientâ€™s condition, we plan treatment combined with other cancer treatment
						options, be it medical or therapeutic, ensuring safety and comfort of the patient. During the
						treatment, we also plan for proactively managing the side-effects of the procedure to be done
						and post-operative management together with rehabilitation therapists.</p>
